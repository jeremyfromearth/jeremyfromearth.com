caption: The World of AEP is a 26 screen interactive multi-touch installation that fills an entire wall of the main lobby at the American Electric Power headquarters in Columbus, OH. The entire display is powered by my open source library, [MagicWindow](https://github.com/jeremyfromearth/magic-window), that enables developers to quickly build software for multi-screen layouts.

The upper five monitors of the presentation display thematically grouped quotes from AEP employees and awards won by the company. Real-time stock data, powered by [AlphaVantage](https://alphanvantage.co) APIs, scrolls along the bottom of the screens, displaying current prices and flucuations of select AEP related symbols.
