<h3>Hello, my name is Jeremy</h3>

<div class="about">
  <img src="/assets/images/portrait_mosaic.gif"></img>
  <p>I am a creative technologist working and living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. Currently, I am employed by <a href="http://hello-upswell.com">Upswell</a> where I develop software for digital installations, exhibits and various other platforms.</p>

  <p>I started writing software in 2004. Back then, I was mostly building sites for friends and doing a lot of learning. A few years later, I landed a job as a Software Developer with <a href="http://secondstory.com/projects/search?q=jeremy%20brown">Second Story</a>, a small firm with a focus on digital story-telling.</a> It was while working at Second Story that I learned object oriented design patterns and what it meant to work as a part of a creative team.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of 2010, I left Second Story and went on to launch a career as a freelancer developer. As a freelancer, I traveled through Europe and worked on various projects for stateside clients. One of which was Upswell, who, earlier this year, I joined forces with.</p>

  <p>I work with multiple technology stacks and platforms on a daily basis. You can view my <a href="/work">work</a> page and see a list of the technologies used used for each project.
