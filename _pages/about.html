<h2>Hello, my name is Jeremy</h2>

<div class="about">
    <p>I am a freelance <em><span id="job-title">software developer</span></em>

    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>My interests in coding began in 2004. At the time I was working at a musical instrument store and was very involved in music production. I operated a small analog recording studio where I learned about crafting and creating sound. Over time my studio became more and more digital and as it shed tape machines in place of hard disks I became more and more fascinated by the creative possibilities that computers were able to facilitate.</p>

    <p>Over the next few years I spent hours learning about digital media, sotware development and web programming. I honed my skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ActionScript and Processing. The Flash platform, while now widely unpopular, was the only framework at the time that enabled for complex graphics to be rendered on the web. I began to combine my interest in sound with graphical elements and built a collection of experimental sound art pieces.</p>

    <p>In 2007 I became aware of Second Story Interactive and their impressive portfolio of immersive museum content. It was then that I found the path that I would follow for what has now been almost 10 years. I worked at Second Story from 2007 to 2010. There, I learned how to think about software in an object oriented way, how to orgranize my time, to write specifications and most importantly, how to collaborate within a team. It was a formative experience. In 2010, left Second Story to begin a career as a freelance developer.</p>

    <p>Since then, my work has continued to evolve. I've developed software for mobile platforms, the web, large interactive installations and the desktop. Over time, my interest in the work I do has only become stronger. I take on projects that I believe in and know that I can become personally vested in. I truly love my work.<p>
