### The following is a quick synopsis of the open source software projects that I've developed and continue to work on daily.
<br/>

### [cinder-sprite][cinder-sprite]
###### __C++, OpenGL, Cinder__
A multi-purpose display component for Cinder applications enabling various media types (image, video, text and web content) to be rendered with a simple, common interface. I use this code in many of the multi-screen installations projects I work on.<br/>[» View on Github][cinder-sprite]

### [electron-touchscreen][electron-touchscreen]
###### __JavaScript, NodeJS, Electron__
Boilerplate code for quickly setting up an Electron app as a touch-screen kiosk!<br/>[» View on Github][electron-touchscreen]

### [hex](https://github.com/jeremyfromearth/hex)
###### __C++__
Hex is a hexagonal grid layout library. Hexagonal grids are great for creating more interesting layout systems than traditional Cartesion (square grid systems). The code is inspired by a collection of [tutorials by Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/).<br/>[» View on Github][hex]

### [magic-window](https://github.com/jeremyfromearth/magic-window)
###### __C++, OpenGL, Cinder__
This project enables developers to create multi-window software using the [Cinder][cinder] framework. In my experience, one of the best approaches to acheiving native high resoltion rendering at 60fps is to use multiple application windows and to split the rendering of a massive canvas across them. A Magic Window based app can be configured to display in grid, custom or display (use all available windows) modes and can be scaled to allow an otherwise enormous canvas to be rendered on even a laptop screen. I've used Magic Window in many large format installations with great success.<br/>[» View on Github][magic-window]

### [metonymn](https://github.com/jeremyfromearth/metonym)
###### __Python, JavaScript, D3.js, HTML5__ 
Metonym is a tool for generating data for Natural Language Processing tasks. It enables a user to create a vast set of permutations of textual input using a concise syntax. This is particularly useful for creating test/train sets for machine learning problems such as intent detection and entity recognition. At the time of this writing the project is still very much a work in progress, but is show some great promise.

### [muse](https://github.com/jeremyfromearth/muse)
###### __JavaScript__
A JavaScript audio engine providing sample accurate sequencing of audio data. It supports the sequencing of both synthesized audio and audio from .wav file format.<br/>[» View on Github][muse]

### [naetura](https://github.com/jeremyfromearth/naetura)
###### __JavaScript__
A playground for creating visualizations of mathematical interpretations of natural phenomenon.

### [pixelspace](https://github.com/jeremyfromearth/pixelspace)
###### __JavaScript__
Pixelspace is a drawing library for JavaScript. It wraps the HTML5 Canvas and provides some boilerplate for creating interactive visualizations and many helpful functions for drawing all manner of shapes.<br/>[» View on Github][pixelspace]

### [uibot](https://github.com/jeremyfromearth/uibot)
###### __JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3__
UIBot is a utility that seeks to automate, as much as possible, the tedium of manually creating HTML user interfaces and wiring them up to control variables in interactive sketches. UIBot is responsive and can be styled to match any project using CSS. It is intended to be used with projects like Pixelspace, Processing.js or three.js and takes inspiration from [dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) and .<br/>[» View on Github][uibot]
