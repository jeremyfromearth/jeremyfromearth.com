[University of Washington - Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning)
This Specialization provides a case-based introduction to the exciting, high-demand field of machine learning. Youâ€™ll learn to analyze large and complex datasets, build applications that can make predictions from data, and create systems that adapt and improve over time.

[Stanford - Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/)
This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, data-mining, and statistical pattern recognition.

[Stanford - Mining Massive Datasets](https://www.coursera.org/course/mmds)
This class teaches algorithms for extracting models and other information from very large amounts of data. The emphasis is on techniques that are efficient and that scale well.

[University of Illinois - Data Mining Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/datamining/)
This Specialization will teach you data mining techniques for both structured data which conform to a clearly defined schema, and unstructured data which exist in the form of natural language text.

[Caltech - Learning From data](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html)
This is an introductory course in machine learning (ML) that covers the basic theory, algorithms, and applications.
