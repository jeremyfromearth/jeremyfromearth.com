Shortly after launching this site in 2015, I became very busy with work and life and didn't make enough time for maintaining it. In the meantime, I worked on many interesting projects and learned a lot. I'm looking forward to getting back into the rhythm of writing about my experiments and work in programming and various tech. In an attempt to bolster some momentum and reacquaint myself with the code for this site, I've spent the past few days making some long intended updates which have included the following: 

 * Removing Grunt & Bower
 * Adding BabelJS to the build process so that I can code in ES6
 * Using NPM for dependency management
 * Converting [Pixelspace](https://github.com/jeremyfromearth/pixelspace) to ES6
 * Adding D3.js as a tool for creating visualizations
 * Creating a more interesting archive for my [work](/work)
 * Adding comments to blog posts using [Staticman](https://staticman.net/)

 There are still a few more features that I'm planning to add to this site too:
  * Dark mode
  * Chat, so anyone visiting the site can chat with me in realtime
  * A custom theme for [UIBot](https://github.com/jeremyfromearth/uibot) interfaces in posts and articles

I'm also planning to get more involved in online communities. There once was a time that I spent a lot of time on the Stack Exchange network answering questions and even asking a few [here and there](http://bit.ly/2ns5pSY). I'm going to make an effort to be more involved there again. At some point I may even use this site to share some music I've been working on.

So, to summarize, I'm looking forward to a REBOOT in 2018!
